# Urban Systems
mini-projects for Paul Romer's Urban Systems course at NYU

1. Tallest Buildings (global) - explores global buildings vs city population, 
  * analysis in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/crusselsh/UrbanSystems/blob/master/TallestBuildings/DataClean_Buildings.ipynb) has some matching errors and Geonames appears to have incorrect population counts (eg Buffalo, NY)
  * updated version in STATA as required by Prof Romer, [project files](https://github.com/crusselsh/UrbanSystems/tree/master/TallestBuildings/tallestBuildings_v2)
2. Job gradients (US only) - spatial distribution around CBSA centers
  * initial data download, merge, and distance/bearing calculations in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/crusselsh/UrbanSystems/blob/master/Work_Gradients/Urban-workplace-gradients.ipynb) - average geographic center using all Census Blocks did not estimate city center well in this version
  * graphs and further analyses in these [.do files]()
